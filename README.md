# automatic-mail-sender

### Don't worry about forgetting to send mails now! ✉ ✍ ٩(˘◡˘)۶ 
### Automatic-mail-sender can do it for you. It is a program made with Python that takes the letters (which you have already written) and after getting the input from the .csv file containing the mail, name and date of sending, it just does that for you!

### Here, I have taken the example of birthday letters. Go, fork this code and play with it a little.
